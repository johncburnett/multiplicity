# multiplicity
*multiplicity* is a sound art installation experienced through headphones and controlled by a listener's path through space. By exploring the room, the listener is able to access emplaced soundscapes that transform depending upon their position. This is accomplished through the use of FM radio transmissions and GPS coordinates.
