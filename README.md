# multiplicity
*multiplicity* is a sound art installation experienced through headphones and a viewers path through a space. By exploring the room, the listener is able to access emplaced soundscapes that transform depending upon their position in the room. This is accomplished through the use of FM radio transmissions and GPS coordinates.
